<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kenechukwu Muoneme, I trained as an economist but now turned chartered accountant who is learning how to code. My flare for learning led me into the world of programming, which was birthed out of the desire to marry my skills in finance with tech. I have always considered myself to be curious minded and a life long learner.</p>

<p>Having worked as a budget officer in the public sector, I believe my skills and experiences are transferable and would be of value in the financial technology sector. I hope to one day build applications and websites that solve real-world problems and that would bring ease to everyday living.</p>

<p>I firmly believe in building publicly, which is why I have chosen to document my coding journey (wins and loses) on Twitter, this way I hope to find a community of passionate learners who have the same aspiration of becoming a developer especially those who come from unconventional/non-tech background.</p>
